# Multiple Sclerosis Segmentation Project

## Introduction
This project aims to solve the Multiple Sclerosis Segmentation Challenge, specifically the ISBI 2015 and MSSEG 2016 challenges.

## Challenge Description
The ISBI 2015 and MSSEG 2016 challenges focus on segmenting multiple sclerosis lesions in brain MRI scans. The goal is to develop accurate and efficient algorithms that can automatically identify and segment these lesions.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- Develop a deep learning model for multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation.
- Evaluate the model's performance using the ISBI 2015 and MSSEG 2016 datasets.
- Compare the results with state-of-the-art methods and benchmark performance.

## Methodology
The project will follow the following methodology:
1. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the MRI scans to enhance the lesion features and remove noise.
2. Model development: Design and train a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for lesion segmentation.
3. Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as Dice coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity.
4. Comparison with existing methods: Compare the results with other state-of-the-art methods and analyze the performance differences.

## Results and Conclusion
The project aims to achieve accurate and efficient segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions. The results will be presented and analyzed, highlighting the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.
